# Prerequisites

- Works on latest **MacOS** and **Ubuntu Linux**.
- `node` & `npm` for the CLI.
- `uvx` for most of the servers. 
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed. (if you'd like director to configure them automatically).


# Quickstart

The fastest way to try director is to use the install script. This will download the dependencies, run the latest version of director and open up the studio in your browser:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://director.run/install.sh | sh
director quickstart
```

# Alternative Methods

## Installing Locally

If you'd like to install director locally, you can do so via `npm`.

```bash
npm install -g @director.run/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director studio # open the studio in your browser
```

## Getting started with the CLI

If you'd like to set up director without going through the UI, you can do so via the CLI. For more detailed information, check out the [CLI Reference](../concepts/cli).

```bash
npm install -g @director.run/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director create my-first-playbook # create a playbook
director add my-first-playbook --entry fetch # add the fetch server to the playbook
director connect my-first-playbook --target claude # connect the playbook to Claude
director connect my-first-playbook --target cursor # connect the playbook to Cursor
director connect my-first-playbook # print the manual connection details
```
