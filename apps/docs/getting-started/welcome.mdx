[Director](https://director.run) allows you to provide **playbooks** to AI Agents. A playbook is a set of **MCP tools**, **prompts** and **configuration** that give agents new **skills**. You can connect Claude, Cursor and VSCode in 1-click, or integrate manually through a single MCP endpoint.

Playbooks are portable, declarative YAML files that can easily be shared (or committed to version control). Director is local-first - installation and client integration takes 30 seconds. Director provides all the MCP management functionality you'd expect: tool filtering, logging, strong isolation, and unified OAuth.
