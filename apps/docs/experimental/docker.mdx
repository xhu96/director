We currently have an experimental Docker image that you can use to run the gateway in a containerized environment.

**Note:** Automatic client connections are not supported in the Docker image. You will need to connect manually using the connect command.

```bash
# Start the gateway container, listening on port 8080
# Mount the data directory to persist the gateway's state (config files, etc)
docker run \
        -d -p 3673:8080 \
        -v ./data:/root/.director \
        --name director \
        barnaby/director:latest

# Tail the logs
docker logs -f director

# Interact with the gateway using the CLI, on the host machine
director create my-playbook
director add my-playbook --entry fetch
director connect my-playbook # print connection details
```
