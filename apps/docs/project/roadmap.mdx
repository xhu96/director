Below is our tentative roadmap for the next few months. We're actively working on the following:

#### Now
- **Secret Management**: Store secrets outside of the config file.
- **Hosting**: Support for hosting director instances in the cloud.

#### Next
- **ACL**: Support for ACLs to control access to the director instance.
- **Desktop Application**: OSX Desktop application for managing director instances.

#### Later
- **Plugins**: Support for plugins to extend the functionality of director.
