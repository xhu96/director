We take security seriously and appreciate coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities.

- **Report security issues**: Email `security@director.run` with details and reproduction steps. Please include impact, affected components/versions, and any proof-of-concept.
- **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt within 2 business days and provide a tracking reference.
- **Communication**: We will share remediation progress at least weekly until resolution and coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.
- **Scope**: All Director-owned code, services, and domains.
- **Safe harbor**: If you follow this policy, test only your own accounts/data, and avoid privacy violations or service disruption, we will not pursue or support legal action against you for your research.

Thank you for helping keep our community safe.
